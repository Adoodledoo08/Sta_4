# Check assumptions ----
# Homogeneity of variances

leveneTest(PHQ9 ~ LivingWith*Area, data=housing_data) # If Levene's test is not significant, we meet the assumption of homogeneity of variances (equal variances)
# THE LEVENE'S TEST IS SIGNIFICANT IN SPSS BUT NOT HERE

#Check the normality assumption
plot(housing_model, 2) # This gives us the Q-Q Plot
